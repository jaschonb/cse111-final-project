# cse111-final-project
This is my final project for CSE111

This project is a password generator program that aims to apply the concepts learned in the CSE111 course. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the use of the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.

The password generator program offers the following features:
- GUI-based interface for generating passwords
- Customization options to create strong passwords
- Ability to save passwords, along with associated usernames and websites, to a chosen file
- Display of the generated password on the screen
