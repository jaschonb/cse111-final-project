# cse111-final-project
This is my final project for CSE111

# Introduction
This project is a password generator program that aims to apply the concepts learned in the CSE111 course. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate the use of the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.

# Features
The password generator program offers the following features:
- GUI-based interface for generating passwords
- Customization options to create strong passwords
- Ability to save passwords, along with associated usernames and websites, to a chosen file
- Display of the generated password on the screen

# Files
The project consists of the following files:
- "strong_password_generator.py": This is the main program that creates the GUI and executes the functions for the password generator. It incorporates the Tkinter library to build the graphical interface and handles the password generation and saving functionality.
- "number_entry.py": This file is not created by you but provided by the university. It is a program that facilitates number entry within the GUI. You can leverage this code to enhance user experience when entering numerical values.
- "test_strong_password_generator.py": This is a testing program that utilizes Pytest, a popular testing framework in Python, to verify the functionality of the functions employed in the main program. The tests ensure that the password generation and saving operations work as expected, increasing the reliability and robustness of your application.
